The program contains the files:
- BitTree.java
- BitTreeLeaf.java
- BitTreeNode.java
- BrailleASCII.java
- BrailleASCIITables.java
- toASCII.txt
- toBraille.txt
- toUnicode.txt
The program creates BitTrees and uses it to perform some manipulations of input/output.
It takes input from the command line and then performs accurate translations.
The translations are:
- from ASCII to Braile
- from Braille to Unicode
- from Braille to ASCII
